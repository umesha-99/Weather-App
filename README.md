# Weather-App
This weather app lets users get weather info for any city. Users will type the city name in a box, click a button, or hit enter to get the weather. JavaScript is used to connect to an open weather API to get the right data for the chosen city. Icons or pictures, like a sun or cloud, will show the weather.
