# Weather-App
This weather app lets users get weather info for any city. Users will type the city name in a box, click a button, or hit enter to get the weather. JavaScript is used to connect to an open weather API to get the right data for the chosen city. Icons or pictures, like a sun or cloud, will show the weather.
If there are issues getting data from the API, we'll use the 'try and catch' method to handle them. This project will help us improve our API skills, error handling, and making user interfaces that are easy to use.
